## Loading data sources

There are 2 main means to load your data source:
1. Use menu _Data/Load data source_

2. Use drag and drop

<img src="../img/getting-started/loading-data-source-2.gif" style="width:100%;" alt="Load data source gif" />

During loading usually the dialog with available data source is shown. In this dialog it is possible to delete a data source, set a particular style for plots from this data source, set some filter for data, etc.



## Creating simple plots

To create a new plot use menu _Plot/New plot_ or a button on the top left side of main window.

After that a menu shown where you can choose data you would like to draw. To choose a parameter just click on it.

By default all parameter will be considered by **jag** as function of some independent argument (usually it is time or something like that). If you don't want to draw function _parameter1 = f(argument)_ but want to draw function _parameter1 = f(parameter2)_ use the left button of the mouser to choose _parameter1_ and the right button to choose _parameter2_ as an argument.

## Modes

Jag main window can be in several modes (switch from one mode to another is usually achieved by using buttons in the toolbar):

1. Normal mode

In this mode you can move graphs from one axis to another

2. Measuring mode

In this mode you can explore data values. Current values of all graphs are shown at the bottom of the main window. If you move mouse with the left button pressed it is possible to measure distance between 2 particular points.

5. Remark drawing mode

6. Zoom x mode

7. Zoom y mode

8. Zoom xy mode

9. Motion mode
