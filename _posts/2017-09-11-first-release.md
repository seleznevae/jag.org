## Jag in a nutshell 

**Jag** is a simple graphing application which can be used to create simple 2D plots. No bar charts, 3D graphs, surfaces, maps... **Only simple 2D plots!** So according to one of UNIX principles it does only one thing, but tries to do it well. 

Jag was initially designed for engineers who spend a bunch of time analyzing results of mathematical modeling so that they can get most out of their data. So the main goal was to simplify and speed up graph creation and layout manipulations. It enables to create pretty nice plots in a few seconds. See [getting started](https://github.com/seleznevae/jag/issues)



## Supported data formats 

At the moment *jag* supports data *.csv
format and data in simple table format. However, number of file formats than can be loaded may be extended by a user with custom plugins.


## Wishes

I hope you will like **jag** and find it usefull in everyday routine work. Feel free to post your comments, bug reports and wishes here and at [github](https://github.com/seleznevae/jag/issues).

You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
